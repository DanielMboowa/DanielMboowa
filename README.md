#About Me



Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Daniel Mboowa, and I am passionately exploring the world of programming while learning how it applies to various fields within Bioinformatics.

I have already created some projects based on what Iâ€™ve learned, which has helped me solidify my understanding of Python fundamentals. In addition to Python, I am also diving into other programming languages such as R, C, and JavaScript. Balancing these studies hasnâ€™t been easy, especially as Iâ€™m currently a freshman at Westford Academy, MA.

Through this journey, Iâ€™ve come to realize that in programming, your imagination is the limit. With AI revolutionizing how problems are solved across diverse industries, Iâ€™m inspired to use this opportunity to understand and leverage Bioinformatics tools to simplify and enhance the work of Bioinformaticians.

#Projects

To deepen my understanding of Python, Iâ€™ve built a variety of small projects. These serve not only as learning experiences but also as valuable references whenever I need to recalibrate and stay on track.
